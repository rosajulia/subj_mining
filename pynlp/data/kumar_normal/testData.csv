facebook_corpus_msr_411691	"Saw today's news, that HC Delhi, clear the decks for TATA Sons to pay US$1.18 Billions to DoCoMo for honouring its commitment made while DocoMo agreed to purchase26% stake in Tata Tele services in 2009 at US$2.7Billion.(The then prevailing market price.)All tax experts are hailing the judgement as, gr8 transperent and strong legal system. This judgenent will encourage more FDI . Blah blah blah.I fail to understand, all that is fine, ""to uphold the agreement"". However such protection is not available to all sundry.When we, retail investers purchase shares at the then prevailing market price, why we are not allowed to incorporate such clause, ""should the market price fall 50% of it, Company should give us back at least 50% of the price at which we had purchased the share in market."" That time the clause is , ""Investment in market is subject to risk, you may loose your money completely, kindly take advice from experts before investing.""To understand more clearly a retail invester's agony, lets take an example. Many must have invested in IPOs at a premium , in ""Co A"", believing  tall claims made by promoters. They invested in Rs.10 face valyed share at say Rs225.00 in say 2009 same time when Docomo invested in Tata Tele Services.Sadly today the said "" Co A"" share market price falls to Rs3.00.Now can any one of these investers, such aggrived retail invrster approch the company to pay atleast Rs112.50 ( 50% of stake price invested). Just like DoCoMo approaching Tata Sons, to repurchase their shares at 50% of stake price.I know, tax experts (hailing the Delhi HC judgement ) will say, where is the agreement between the company and retail investers?Thats exactly, where the shoe pinches. All our system, laws tries to protect interests of super HNIs only.If Delhi HC feels such clause of protecting 50% of stakeholders price is fair, should not The Govt too amended suitably the existing Company Law, in oder to protect retail investers stakes in comoany.? There pl don't insist on defence, our clause clearly states, your investnents are subject to market risks, may loose your money in entireity.Will RBI go ahead to appeal in SC? Will our Govt force the pramoters to safeguard the retail investers investments? Well may not be at 50% of their market priced investment, but on some clearly defined prorata basis."	non-aggressive

facebook_corpus_msr_492210	Why Ola &amp; Uber are ponzis. ??? By definition a ponzi is a fraud scheme that promises high and quick returns to the original investors at the cost of new investors . In Ola and Uber , the old investors were drivers and owners who put in their own cars with assurance from Ola and Uber of business per day of at least rs 3000 per day . Photo no 1 proof . Misleading advertisements. 2) once the car owner investors got human resource and trained their drivers and took responsibility of accidents, Ola management introduced their own fleet. ( mainly Maruti swift Desire, Sx 4 &  Datsun cars ) They also poached drivers of investor cars promising them ownership of company cars if they drove currently at a low wage as low as 3-4000 per month. To penalise drivers of investor cars , Ola started giving false bookings to drivers and levies penalty if drivers cancelled those . Deliberate false calls and waiting for client , if cancelled by driver - penalty ! Proof photo no 2 Fraud business showed navigation of client pick up through Arabian sea , proving navigational errors in the software of Ola & Uber . Proof photo no 3 Penalty was levied on drivers for not taking those calls. All complaints made at Andheri Police station but no FIR/ NC made . Senior PI hand in glove with Ola officials . False cases registered against drivers for  violence during peaceful demonstration. video of senior PI Andheri East police station, apologising to Taxi drivers sanghatana for false cases being told to do so by seniors and Ola officials , available on what  App and to the media . Statements of taxi Union leaders were taken yesterday . Here the old investors are duped and new investors seem to be the government with probable tie ups with companies like Swift for desire models , Sx4 Datsun . Japanese collaboration. Tip : SX4  Desires have serious blind spot problems . Incoming traffic from right side is not visualised properly due to narrow windscreen and small window size . The GPRS systems employed by cabs on mobiles are stuck on same side as the blind spot mirror , making it more difficult to visualise incoming traffic. The models were hence discontinued . If those are passed on for public transport , it would be a serious public safety issue .	non-aggressive

facebook_corpus_msr_435012	The first budget of Independent India was  presented on 26th November ,1947, by country's first finance  minister RK Shamukham Chetty ,a lawyer ,politician and an economist.No new taxes were proposed as it was an interim budget and the date of annual budget presentation for 1948-49 was just 95 days away.Mr Chetty was asked to step down by PM Nehru shortly afterwards due to minor dereliction of duty by subordinate official to ensure probity.Almost 70 years ago on February 28,in British India , the interim budget was presented by the then Finance Minister in Lord Wavell's cabinet ,Liaquat Ali Khan , who later became first  Prime Minister of Pakistan.His budget was termed as pro poor budget.Salt Tax was completely abolished ,income tax limit raised from  Rs2000 to Rs 2500, heavy taxes were introduced for business  establishments having income of Rs 1,00,000 or more  and a  Commission of Inquiry  was proposed to investigate those who made huge sums of money during WWII.The left  wing of the Indian National Congress (INC) headed by Pt.Nehru and Maulana Azad welcomed  the budget while the right wing headed by C.Rajagopalachari opposed it as the business houses hit by the budget were the main financiers of the INC.Critics of the budget described it as an attempt by Mr Khan to drive wedge between right and left wing of the INC.In independent India ,the budget  of 1985 presented by the then Finance Minister V.P. Singh was hailed as landmark budget by none other than the eminent jurist and tax wizard late Nani Palkhivala , who previously had criticized all other budgets.	non-aggressive

facebook_corpus_msr_437345	Those who seek parity with Army.THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER‚Ä¶ While troopers of PMFs, CPOs, CAPFs seek parity with the Armed Forces in service benefits, can they answer following questions:[Officers form less than 3% of 12.6 Lakh strong Army yet their casualties rate is 11.5%. Is it foolish fatal attraction with death? No way sir, he does it because of what is ingrained in him: My own Safety & Welfare comes Last, Always & Every time. That he would let harm come to his men, 'paltan's izzat' or to innocent citizen, only over his dead body].Q1. Has he served along with Army anywhere ?Q2. Had he gone to Siachin ever ?Q3. Is he aware what's the retirement age of jawaan in army ?Q4. Had he ever compared availability of married accommodation to army with that of PMF ?Q5. Is he aware that Army is yet to get 7th CPC?Q6. Is he aware in the entire service , for how much duration Army personnel keep their families along with them and ever compared with the duration of PMF personnels ?Q7. He talks about casual leave of army but is he aware that out of that leave how much is availed ?Q8. Is he aware that army is doing additional task of maintaining internal peace in which they have failed the nation?Q9. Is he aware about the illness rate in army and the diseases which are common to army personnel? Ever tried to compare the death rate of the Army with other forces?Q10. Is he aware that his departmental officers come under a specific group of service and in places like Guwahati will get more then double the allowance what army officers will get in Siachin Glacier? If that's the difference among the officer cadre then how come Army jawaan can be better?Q11. Had he ever seen his assistant commandants walking through out with his troops during Road Opening Patrol ?Q12. Had he ever compared the casualty rate between the two forces?Q13. Was he stopped by someone from joining the Army ?Q14. Most of the Army jawaans retire by 40yrs of age whereas PMF personnel's serves 15 to 20 years more. If he adds the total pay received by him in serving this additional tenure, he will find himself getting almost thrice in comparison to the army personnel's.Q 15. Does any of his officers lead from the front to take the hail of the first bullets with the troops following behind?Q16. Is he not aware that most of the PMF jawaans become equivalent to a JCO whereas in army it is not even 10% ?There are several other questions too....But here aim is not to raise questions against any organization. Everyone is doing his job, everyone has own problems. This doesn't mean they start seeking  parity in compensation with someone else.	non-aggressive

facebook_corpus_msr_357881	#Mohsin_Khan Islam is a religion of hate. This religion particularly attracts the angry people and the hardened criminals. Most converts to Islam are prison inmates. They are emotionally unbalanced. They feel that they are victimized and they are angry at the world. Islam is a perfect religion for them. It validates their sense of victimization and provides then a definable enemy to hate. The new converts to Islam find a sense of direction in their lives that they never had before. However that is not the direction towards love, inner peace and enlightenment. In Islam they find a venue to express their anger, this time with no bang of conscience but with conviction, determination and a sense of purpose.  Political correctness is a major defect of the western ethos. Some Western countries have even passed blasphemy laws that would put you in legal hot waters if you say anything negative about Islam. This means that the truth about Islam cannot be said but Muslims are given total freedom to spread their religion with lies. Islam thrives were truth is suppressed. That is one reason that westerners convert to Islam. They are lied to. How do you expect a society to survive when truth is banned and lies are allowed? In west lack of political correctness, moral declination and innocency towards Islam and Islamic People in westerns are some of the reasons. In Muslim controlled countries, cunning Islamic laws and high birth rate are main reasons. In East love jihad, vigorous advertising of islam by degrading other religions,  fear blackmailing and Excessive highly birth rate of muslims infants are major reasons for muslim's high population growth rate. So where is the merit of islam in conversions?  Merit of islam in conversions is to provide all pseudo reasons for further immoral actions by new Muslims.	aggressive
